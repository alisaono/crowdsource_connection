      <h1>Crowdsource Connections</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, youâ€™re looking at my final project for 4.110, Design Across Scales,
        a design class taught at MIT. Our theme is 'Powers of Ten' (based on Eames's film)
        and we each have to define a scale for measuring powers of ten.
        I chose the connections between people as my scale. For this project,
        I reached out to ten of my friends and ten of theirs to ask questions.
        I then created a visualization and a fun matching game from their answers.
      </p>

    <div class="section-container">
      <h2>Where are you at?</h2>
      <p>
        These are the locations of the participants when they took the survey.
        The size of marker corresponds to how many people were in the same location.
        Lines represent the connections between participants. The largest marker is
        at Massachusetts, where 26 out of 39 participants were located.
        The data shows that although technology connects people who are physically separated,
        we often use it to communicate with those who are physically nearby.
      </p>
      <div id="location-map"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container">
      <h2>Where are you from?</h2>
      <p>
        These are the places that the participants are originally from.
        Again the size of the marker corresponds to how many people were from the same area
        and lines represent the connections between participants.
        The data shows a lot more diversity in our places of origins than our current locations.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="section-container">
      <h2>What do you like?</h2>
      <p>
        Lastly I decided to create something fun with the participants' favorite
        colors, animals, and food. I ended up making a memory card game since
        I thought it would be interesting to match their favorite animals and foods
        with their faces. Can you find yourself or your friends?
