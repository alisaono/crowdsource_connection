    <h1>Crowdsource Connections</h1>
    <p>
      This is my final project for 4.110, Design Across Scales, a design class taught at MIT.
      Our theme is ‘Powers of Ten’ (based on an Eames’s film) and we are presenting our own scale
      for measuring powers of ten. My scale is the connections between people. For this project,
      I reached out to ten of my friends and ten of theirs and asked a couple of questions and created
      visualizations and a mini game using the responses.
    </p>

    <h2>Where are you at?</h2>
    <p>
      These are the locations of the participants at the time of taking the survey. Size of marker
      corresponds to how many people were in the same location. Lines represent the connections
      between participants. The largest marker is at Massachusetts, where 26 out of 39 participants were located.
    </p>
    <div id="location-map"></div>

    <h2>Where are you from?</h2>
    <p>
      These are the places that the participants are originally from as opposed to their current locations.
      Size of marker again corresponds to how many people were from the same area and Lines represent
      the connections between participants.
    </p>
    <div id="origin-map"></div>

    <h2>What do you like?</h2>
    <p>
      Lastly I decided to create something fun using the participants' favorite colors, animals, and food
      and ended up making a memory card game since I thought it would be interesting to see their favorite
      things, which are usually considered trivia answers, before seeing their faces.
      Can you find yourself or your friends?
